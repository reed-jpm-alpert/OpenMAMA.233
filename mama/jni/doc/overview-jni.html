<p>
MAMA (Middleware Agnostic Messaging API) is a subscription based
middleware API with publish/subscribe semantics which provides a lightweight
abstraction on top of a variety of underlying messaging middlewares.
The purpose of the API is to provide developers with a common view and
interface onto the underlying messaging API in such a manner
that migrating from one messaging API to another requires no code changes.
</p>
<p>
The API provides an asynchronous event driven programming model. As such,
users of the API provide callbacks at various points and data is propagated
back to the registered application via these callbacks in response to 
dispatching of events.
</p>
<p>
The API provides the building blocks for implementing a market data
infrastructure on top of any supported messaging middleware. Market
Data semantics are added through the use of the MAMDA API
(MAMDA Developers guide also available).
</p>
<p>
On the Wombat MAMA MarketData Infrastructure the API also provides extra value
added features, e.g.
