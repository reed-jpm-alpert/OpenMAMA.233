/**
 * This function exists to centralize the allocation of buffer memory. When
 * called for the first time with an empty buffer, it will calloc the requested
 * memory. When requesting a size smaller than the current size, it will do
 * nothing. When requesting a size larger than the current size, it will perform
 * a realloc. On success, MAMA_STATUS_OK will be returned, and if necessary,
 * the buffer pointer will be written back to reflect the new value. The
 * currentSize pointer will also be modified to reflect the new size. On
 * failure, a mama_status will be returned indicating an error and buffer and
 * currentSize will remain unchanged.
 *
 * @param buffer      Pointer to the buffer to examine and resize if necessary.
 * @param size        Current size of the buffer. Will be updated with the newly
 *                    requested newSize on success.
 * @param newSize     The newly requested buffer size.
 *
 * @return mama_status indicating whether the method succeeded or failed.
