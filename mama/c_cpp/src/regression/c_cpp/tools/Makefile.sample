# To build MAMA examples set the following:
#   API_HOME: Path to API installation
#   API_PLATFORM: tibrv/lbm/elvin
#   tibrv_HOME: Path to TIBRV installation (TIBRV only)
#   elvin_HOME: Path to ELVIN installation (ELVIN only)
#   lbm_HOME: Path to LBM installation (LBM only - usually same as API home)
#   wmw_HOME: Path to WMW installation (WMW only)
#=============================================================================
# Example:
#    make -f Makefile.sample API_HOME=/home/wombat/apis

# SOLARIS/Forte: The makefile will need modified to use the Solaris compiler.
#                See example below.
