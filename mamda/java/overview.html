API specification for MAMDA (Middleware Agnostic Market Data API).
<p>
To date, virtually every application programming interface (API)
used in conjunction with market data distribution software provides
an anonymous field and/or record based interface.  Applications
must iterate over fields and provide internal logic to determine
what type of message the collection of fields actually represents.
For some types of applications, such as graphical display
applications (GUIs), it is not necessary for the application to
understand the content of the collection of fields; it only needs
to display each field on a particular part of the screen.  Other
types of applications, such as program trading, tick capture,
analytical, and smart order routing applications, need a deeper
understanding of the meaning of each field in the message and,
indeed, what type of message the update as a whole
represents.

<p>
Classification of market data messages is not just restricted to
high level message types, such as quotes, trades, order book
updates, security status updates, fundamental data, etc., but also
to subtypes of these messages types: regional vs. consolidated
quotes, regional vs. consolidated trades, trade
cancels/errors/corrections, out of order trades, etc.  The field
based approach to accessing market data requires a great deal of
logic to classify data correctly.

Wombat's Middleware Agnostic Market Data API (MAMDA) provides a
rich set of market data related data structures to address these
shortcomings of field based APIs.  This object oriented (C++ and
Java) API does the tedious work of deciphering field based data
into various types of messages and provides convenient interfaces
for applications to process the different types of data.
